# Simple Go back-end projects
In this repository, I tried to code simple projects that help you understand many fundamentals of back-end programming with Go programming language. These projects are in 3 level of beginner, intermediate, and advanced. 

Right now, the projects are from [roadmap.sh backend projects](https://roadmap.sh/backend/projects) which are 23 in total. But after that new ideas will be added too. If you have one, you can [contact with me](shabanid.zahra@gmail.com).

This Markdown will update after each project is done.

# Beginner level
## Task Tracker
Build a CLI app to track your task and manage your to-do list.
### Requirements
The application should run from the command line, accept user actions and inputs as arguments, and store the tasks in a JSON file. The user should be able to:
- Add, Update, and Delete tasks
- Mark a task as in progress or done
- List all tasks
- List all tasks that are done
- List all tasks that are not done
- List all tasks that are in progress

## Number Guessing Game
Build a simple number guessing game to test your luck.
### Requirements
It is a CLI-based game, so you need to use the command line to interact with the game. The game should work as follows:
- When the game starts, it should display a welcome message along with the rules of the game.
- The computer should randomly select a number between 1 and 100.
- User should select the difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) which will determine the number of chances they get to guess the number.
- The user should be able to enter their guess.
- If the user's guess is correct, the game should display a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts it took to guess the number.
- If the user's guess is incorrect, the game should display a message indicating whether the number is greater or less than the user's guess.
- The game should end when the user guesses the correct number or runs out of chances.

## Weather API
Build a weather API that fetches and returns weather data.
### Requirements
In this project, instead of relying on our own weather data, we will build a weather API that fetches and returns weather data from a 3rd party API. This project will help you understand how to work with 3rd party APIs, caching, and environment variables.
